# NY_Automation

AppiumTestAutomation
====================

This project exhibits how to do automation testing for Namma Yatri mobile applications using TestNG tool, Appium framework, Selenium (additional) and Java

Prerequisite
=====================
1. Android SDK
2. Appium setup
3. Maven (For managing dependencies)
4. Eclipse (With TestNG plugin)

Installation
=====================
1. Install from git (using git clone)
2. Import the project to Eclipse IDE
3. Run `mvn clean install` to use maven as build tool
4. Check whether maven depencies and JRE system libaries are imported in the project

Run The Project
=====================
This project is created for QA and for developers as well
So the `main` branch is used by QA and the `slack_bot_integration` for the dev people.

For QA :-
1. Run the appium server `appium` or `appium -p <port number>` in terminal or appium application
2. Check whether the port running in server and in code (src/main/java/base/BaseClass) are same
3. Import APKs which has to be tested, in the apk location folder : src/main/java/NYAutomation.resources
4. Set the name of the APKs in the BaseClass file
5. Either, open two emulators from Android studio or connect two mobile devices
6. Run `adb devices` on the terminal and check whether the devices are connected properly
7. The reports are generated by Allure, so have to install it. `brew install allure` -> command used to install allure
9. Now can run the project by right click on the entire project file -> Run As -> click on Maven Test
10. Then the project will get start, and run in the TestNG (testing framework) from Appium framework with Maven dependency
11. After the automation is done, reports are generated for the pass and fail test cases
12. Report files will be generated in a specified folder (/NY_Automation/allure-results)
13. To see the report, first need to generate the report `allure generate allure-results --clean -o allure-report`
14. Report needs a server to open the report in the webpage, use this command to open the report `allure serve <path of the allure-results>`

For DEVS :-
1. Since dev has to do quick and easy basic testing, a slack bot is integrated in the automation framework, so they can just follow the commands mentioned in the bot documentation to perform automation testing
2. No setup is required, all the servers are deployed in the linux machine
3. Just run the specific commands, and get the allure reports in the bot itself
